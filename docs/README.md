# Pokedex

This project is a Pokemon explorer web application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse and filter Pokemon based on their types. The application retrieves data from the PokeAPI to display information and images of different Pokemon.

## Features

- Pokemon list: The application displays a list of Pokemon with their images, names, and types.
- Filter by type: Users can select one or more Pokemon types to filter the displayed Pokemon list.
- Detailed view: Clicking on a Pokemon card reveals a detailed view with additional information such as stats and a larger image.
- Dynamic styling: Each Pokemon card is styled based on its primary type, providing a visually appealing and immersive experience.

## Learning Outcome

Through this project, you will gain experience and knowledge in the following areas:

- HTML: Understand and implement the structure of the web application using HTML elements.
- CSS: Apply styles and layouts to create an attractive and responsive user interface.
- JavaScript: Use JavaScript to fetch data from an API, manipulate the DOM, and handle user interactions.
- Asynchronous programming: Learn to handle asynchronous operations when fetching data from external APIs.
- API integration: Retrieve data from an external API (PokeAPI) and display it in your application.
- Dynamic filtering: Implement dynamic filtering functionality to show specific Pokemon based on user-selected types.
- Card-based UI: Create a card-based layout to display Pokemon information in an organized and visually appealing manner.
